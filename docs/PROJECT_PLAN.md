Complete Project Development Plan

Iranian-First Infrastructure  |  Blackout-Resilient Architecture

Solo Build with Claude Code  |  February 2026  |  Version 3.0

# CONFIDENTIAL

Executive Summary
ClanTrader is a competitive social trading platform where every user is verified by real trading statements. Traders form clans (teams of 3-6), compete in monthly seasons, share content, and build verified reputations.




Iranian-First Architecture
The platform runs on a dual-layer system: the Iranian Core (always available) and the International Enhancement Layer (available when global internet is accessible).

Layer 1: Iranian Core (Always Available)
These services run entirely on Iranian servers within the NIN. They require zero international connectivity.


Layer 2: International Enhancement (When Available)
These services improve the experience when international internet is accessible. They degrade gracefully when unavailable.


How the AI Failover System Works
The AI system has an automatic failover chain. When a user sends a query, the system tries each level in order until one responds:

Level 1 (Default): OpenRouter API → routes to Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o, or Gemini based on query type and cost. This gives the highest quality answers. Used when international internet is available.
Level 2 (Auto-failover): Local Ollama server running Mistral 7B (quantized Q4). If the OpenRouter API call fails or times out after 3 seconds, the system automatically routes the query to the local model. The user sees a small indicator: "⚡ Running in local mode" but the experience continues seamlessly.
Level 3 (Emergency cache): Pre-computed responses for the 50 most common queries. If even the local LLM is under heavy load, the system serves cached answers for questions like "top clans this week" or "most traded pairs." Updated every hour when any AI is available.




Server Infrastructure
Recommended Iranian Hosting Providers
Based on research into reliability, support quality, developer features, and NIN stability during recent shutdowns:


Server Setup: Three Servers

Server 1: Production Application Server (Iranian VPS)
This is the main server your users connect to. Runs the Next.js app, PostgreSQL, Socket.io, and Nginx.


Software stack: Node.js 20 LTS, PostgreSQL 16, Nginx (reverse proxy + SSL), PM2 (process manager), Redis (caching + session store), Socket.io (realtime).

Server 2: AI / LLM Server (Iranian VPS or Dedicated)
Runs Ollama with open-source models. This is the fallback AI that keeps working during blackouts. Can be the same server as production if budget is tight, but a separate server is strongly recommended for performance.



Recommended Models for Ollama (Ranked)

Mistral 7B Instruct (Q4_K_M): Best balance of quality and speed. 4.1 GB on disk. Works great for structured queries. Apache 2.0 license.
Llama 3 8B Instruct (Q4_K_M): Slightly larger (4.9 GB) but better reasoning. Good for complex clan analysis queries.
Qwen 2.5 7B (Q4_K_M): Strong multilingual support including better Farsi understanding. Worth testing for your Persian-speaking users.
Phi-4 Mini 3.8B (Q4_K_M): Smallest option (~2.5 GB). Very fast even on CPU. Use this if your AI server is resource-limited.


Server 3: Dev Server (Iranian VPS)
Your development and testing environment. Can be a smaller, cheaper VPS from the same provider.


Dev server has its own PostgreSQL database with test/seed data
Same codebase as prod, deployed via Git 'develop' branch
All user testing before public launch happens here
Claude Code reminder in CLAUDE.md: never deploy untested code to production

Server Deployment Architecture

Development flow (Starlink-friendly, blackout-safe): Code locally with Claude Code → Push to GitHub (backup + version history) → Deploy to Iranian DEV via SSH/rsync → Test with beta users → Promote to PROD via SSH/rsync. Deployment does NOT require the Iranian servers to access GitHub (important during blackouts).
Optional local Git: self-host Gitea on the Iranian dev/prod server (or a separate local VPS). You can push to both GitHub (international backup) and Gitea (domestic). During blackouts, servers pull from Gitea inside NIN without touching international Git services.

Git branches: 'main' = production, 'develop' = dev server, feature branches for new work
Environment files: .env.development and .env.production control which database, APIs, and models are used
The AI server is shared between dev and prod (separate API keys for rate limiting)
Backups: Daily PostgreSQL dumps to a separate storage location on the same server

Monthly Infrastructure Cost Estimate





Development Approach: Iranian-First, Not Fallback


How This Works in Practice with Claude Code
For each phase, Claude Code builds the feature in this order:

Step 1: Build the core feature using only Iranian infrastructure (PostgreSQL, local storage, Socket.io, NextAuth). Test it. Make sure it works perfectly in isolation.
Step 2: Add the international enhancement on top (OpenRouter for AI, Myfxbook for verification). The enhancement connects through the AIRouter or a similar abstraction layer.
Step 3: Test the failover. Simulate a blackout by blocking international API calls. Verify the feature still works with the local/cached alternative.

This is NOT building each phase twice. It is building each phase once with a proper abstraction layer. The AI example makes this clear:

You build ONE AI chat interface for users
Behind it is ONE AIRouter class that accepts a query and returns a response
The AIRouter internally tries OpenRouter first, then Ollama, then cache
The UI does not know or care which backend answered the query
This is good software engineering regardless of the Iran situation — it makes the AI system resilient to any API outage
UI/UX Direction: Telegram Navigation DNA (Not a Telegram Clone)
Goal: reduce onboarding friction for Iranian users by borrowing Telegram Web's layout habits (left sidebar + right content panel, fast search, unread indicators) while making it obvious this is a competitive trading platform.
Key principle: Telegram's skeleton, ClanTrader's soul. Users should feel familiar in the first 3 seconds, then immediately discover trading-only features (verified stats everywhere, seasons, leaderboards, badges, AI in chat, stories with win-rate overlays).
Implementation notes:
- App shell: responsive two-panel layout like Telegram Web (desktop) and list -> view navigation (mobile).
- Left sidebar lists: clan private chats + followed clan channels, with search and unread badges.
- Channel view: Telegram-style broadcast posts (text/images/charts, reactions, view counts) with verified trader stats embedded under the author.
- Top bar: always shows current season status (days left), your clan rank, and quick access to leaderboard/discover.



Development Phases
Baseline estimated timeline: 18-20 weeks (~5 months). With an experienced developer using Claude Code full-time (5-10 hours/day), a realistic MVP launch target is 16-20 weeks (~4-5 months), assuming tight scope control.

⬜ Stories viewer (tap-through format, verified badge + win rate visible on every story)
⬜ Clan content library (permanent posts: tutorials, strategy guides, trade breakdowns)
⬜ Content creation editor (rich text, image embedding, chart markup tools)
⬜ Daily peek system (3 free premium post peeks per day for non-subscribers)
⬜ Story analytics for pro users (views, taps, engagement rates)




⬜ PHASE 6 — NOT STARTED: This is the most architecturally important phase. Build the AIRouter system that transparently handles failover between OpenRouter and local Ollama.

Step 1: Build the AIRouter Service
⬜ Create AIRouter class that accepts a query and returns a response
⬜ Implement provider chain: OpenRouter → Ollama → Cache
⬜ Add 3-second timeout for OpenRouter calls before falling to Ollama
⬜ Build health check that pings OpenRouter every 60 seconds to detect connectivity status
⬜ Create model config file: specify which OpenRouter model for which query type, which Ollama model as fallback
⬜ Implement response caching: cache every successful AI response in Redis with 1hr TTL
⬜ Build admin toggle to force local-only mode (useful during known shutdown periods)

Step 2: Set Up Local Ollama
⬜ Install Ollama on the AI server (dedicated Iranian VPS or dedicated machine)
⬜ Download models: Mistral 7B, Llama 3 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Phi-4 Mini (all Q4 quantized)
⬜ Configure Ollama to expose API on internal network (not public-facing)
⬜ Create system prompts optimized for each local model (shorter, more structured than cloud prompts)
⬜ Load test: simulate 10 concurrent queries on the local model to establish baseline performance

Step 3: Build AI Features
⬜ Spectator AI chatbot (chat interface, 3 free questions/day for non-pro users)
⬜ System prompt with database query access (top clans, trending instruments, trader search)
⬜ Clan AI assistant (@ai mention trigger in clan chat, pro-only feature)
⬜ Clan-specific context (members, stats, history) injected into clan AI prompts
⬜ Recruiting assistant ('Find us a free agent who trades gold with low drawdown')
⬜ Competitive intelligence ('Clan X just passed us, what changed?')
⬜ Weekly auto-generated clan performance summary (runs on schedule, uses cheapest available model)

Step 4: Optimize for Blackout Mode
⬜ Pre-compute and cache top-50 common platform queries every hour
⬜ Build a 'Platform Intelligence Snapshot' that runs daily: aggregates all clan stats, trending instruments, performance summaries into a JSON blob that the local AI can reference without database queries
⬜ Create simplified system prompts for Ollama that work with smaller context windows
⬜ Add a UI indicator for users: green dot = cloud AI, yellow dot = local AI, gray dot = cached responses



⬜ PHASE 7 — NOT STARTED: Payment integration uses Iranian gateways that work on NIN. No Stripe dependency for domestic users.

Iranian Payment Gateways


Tasks
⬜ Integrate ZarinPal as primary payment gateway (using their Node.js SDK)
⬜ Build Pro plan checkout flow (monthly and annual options, priced in Toman)
⬜ Create channel subscription marketplace UI (browse clan channels, preview free posts, subscribe for premium posts)
⬜ Channel pricing controls (each clan sets monthly price in Toman; optional daily/weekly passes later)
⬜ Build marketplace commission split (70-80% to clan, 20-30% platform)
⬜ Create revenue dashboard for clans (subscribers, earnings, payout history)
⬜ Build subscriber management for clans (view subscribers, engagement metrics)
⬜ Implement featured placement system (clans pay for boosted visibility)
⬜ Build billing management page (plan changes, payment history, cancel/resume)

Pricing Strategy (in Toman, adjust to market)
Pro Plan: ~500,000-900,000 Toman/month (~$10-18 at current rates)
Channel Subscription: set by clan, expected range 200,000-2,000,000 Toman/month
Daily Pass: 50,000-200,000 Toman
Featured Placement: 300,000-1,500,000 Toman/day



🔶 PHASE 8 — IN PROGRESS: Final polish, the dev/prod split, staged user testing, and public launch.

Dev Server Setup
⬜ Provision separate Iranian VPS for dev environment (dev.clantrader.ir)
⬜ Deployment strategy: prefer SSH/rsync deploys from development machine to dev/prod servers
⬜ Set up separate PostgreSQL database with test/seed data on dev server
⬜ Verify all environment variables are correctly separated between dev and prod

Polish & Optimization
✅ Mobile responsive design (Telegram-like layout, overflow fixes, narrow screen support)
✅ PWA with custom service worker (offline support, install prompts, background sync)
✅ Gzip compression for throttled connections
✅ Self-hosted fonts (Vazirmatn, Sahel, Inter, Geist, Plus Jakarta Sans)
✅ Multi-font switching system
✅ Dark mode support (next-themes)
✅ Error handling (empty states, loading states, connection status indicators)
⬜ Performance optimization (lazy loading, image compression, query optimization)
⬜ SEO setup for .ir domain (meta tags, Open Graph, sitemap)
⬜ Security audit (SQL injection prevention, rate limiting, input sanitization, CSRF)
⬜ Email notification system (welcome, season reminders, ranking changes)
⬜ Onboarding flow for new users (guided tour, explain features, prompt verification)

Testing Infrastructure (Done)
✅ E2E test suite with Playwright
✅ Smoke test suite
✅ Simulator tests
✅ Test runner with distributed worker support
✅ Test run tracking in database
✅ Admin test dashboard

Blackout Resilience Test
⬜ Disconnect the production server from international internet (block all non-.ir traffic)
⬜ Test EVERY feature in NIN-only mode: login, upload, chat, stories, AI, leaderboard, payments
⬜ Verify AI failover: OpenRouter fails → Ollama responds → user experience is seamless
⬜ Verify payment gateway works in NIN-only mode
⬜ Run a simulated 24-hour blackout test with the beta group

Staged Launch
⬜ Week 16-17: Internal testing — you use every feature, find and fix bugs
⬜ Week 17-18: Alpha — 10-15 trusted traders test on dev server
⬜ Week 18-19: Founding clans — help alpha testers form 5-10 clans on prod server
⬜ Week 19-20: Beta — expand to 100-200 users on prod, monitor performance at scale
⬜ Week 20: Public soft launch — announce to Telegram first, then Instagram and YouTube




User Testing Strategy
Testing with real users happens at multiple checkpoints. All testing before public launch happens on the DEV server.




Timeline Overview





The Blackout Advantage
This section explains why the Iranian-first architecture is not just a defensive measure — it is your single biggest competitive advantage.

What Happens During a Shutdown


When the internet goes down and millions of Iranian users lose access to every social platform they use daily, ClanTrader is the one place that still works. Your clans are still chatting. Your leaderboard is still updating. Your stories are still posting. Your AI assistant is still answering questions.

This is not a minor feature. This is the single most powerful user acquisition and retention tool you could possibly have. Every shutdown becomes a marketing event. Every blackout proves the platform's value. Users who experience ClanTrader during a shutdown will never leave, because they know this is the platform that never abandons them.

ClanTrader  —  Built for Resilience


# UPDATED DEVELOPMENT & DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (FINAL)
This section supersedes all previous references to local Windows development or WSL-based workflows.
## 1. Development Environment (Authoritative)
- Primary development is performed on a remote Ubuntu 24 server located outside Iran.
- Claude Code CLI (Opus) is installed and used exclusively on this development server.
- Developer connects via SSH / VS Code Remote SSH.
- Development environment always has international internet access.
- Development is completely unaffected by Iranian blackouts.
## 2. Production Environment (Iran)
- Production server is hosted inside Iran and must remain operational during internet blackouts.
- The production server MUST NOT depend on GitHub, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Microsoft services, or any international API at runtime.
- The production server runs the web app, PostgreSQL, Socket.io, local file storage, and later a local Ollama fallback.
## 3. Deployment Model (Push-Only, Blackout-Safe)
- All builds are created on the development server.
- Deployment is performed by pushing artifacts to the Iranian production server via SSH/rsync.
- The Iranian server never pulls code from GitHub.
## 4. Git Strategy
- GitHub is the source of truth and backup.
- Only the development server requires GitHub access.
- Production servers do not require Git access.
- Optional future upgrade: self-hosted Gitea inside Iran.
## 5. AI Usage Separation (Critical Rule)
- Claude Code CLI is strictly development-only.
- Claude Code must never be installed on production servers.
- User-facing AI features are handled separately with blackout-safe fallbacks.
## 6. Blackout Impact Summary
- Development: Not affected
- Coding with Claude: Not affected
- GitHub access (development): Not affected
- Iranian users: Fully operational
- Clan chat and channels: Fully operational
- AI fallback (later phase): Fully operational
## 7. Timeline Impact
This decision removes all Windows/WSL-related risk and increases stability.
Revised expected timeline remains 4–5 months.
